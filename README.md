# Diabetes Prediction

The aim of this project is to develop a streamlit application that allows users to enter the health related information, then it predicts whether the user has diabetes or not by using machine learning. The process involves:

### 1. Data Collection:
The dataset is collected from the kaggle.

### 2. Data cleaning:
Using Python and Pandas to clean the data.

### 3. Preprocessing the data:
Converting categorical data into numeric values by using OrdinalEncoder.

### 4. Train and test the data:
Train the test the data by using decision tree classifier.

### 5. Dashboard Creation:
Using Streamlit to build the dashboard.
